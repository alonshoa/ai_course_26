# Introduction to Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning  
Welcome to the AI & ML course designed for high school students with **no prior background** in programming or mathematics.  
The course is structured in independent **modules**, each covering a specific concept or skill. New modules will be added gradually throughout the year.

The goal of the course is to build a practical and intuitive understanding of AI —  
from working with data to building and training real neural networks.

# 📚 Table of Contents by Modules  
Each row includes:  
**Topic** – **Short explanation** – **Link to its learning page** (currently WIP and will be added over time).

> 🛠️ All pages are currently marked as WIP until content is created.
